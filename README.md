### Documenting your code

###### Documenting your code is very important.  Complete this lesson called ["Documenting Code"](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/documenting-your-code) from raspberrypi.org to learn how to do it automatically.  Then watch the second video "How to host a website on GitHub" until time 5:19 in the video.  You do not need a first class domain.  Once you have uploaded your website, test it and send me a link so that I can grade it.

### Discussion Questions:

1) Why is it important to include DocStrings in your classes?

2) If Mr. Gerwin had done this to the Pong Class, explain how it would have been easier for a student to read and understand the paddle constructor?

3) Where should you include a link to your website so that people can see it when using the class that you built?
